  -Function name : generate
  -Takes $amount$, the amount of numbers to generate, counting from 0 to $amount - 1$
  -Returns an array containing the specified number of UNIQUE numbers.
  -Calling the function with the same parameter subsequent times will return the array of numbers in a new, random order.
    -For example, calling $generate(1000)$ should return an array that contains 1000 unique numbers.
    -Calling it again should return the same numbers in random order.
